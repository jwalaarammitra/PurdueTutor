# Purdue Tutor
[Purdue Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870OZapB6Xw) is a project I created with Sweta Saravanan and Serena Singh at the Hello World 2019 Hackathon hosted at Purdue University.

## Project Description
The PurdueTutor takes into account the studentâ€™s preferences and connects them with another student tutor fitted to their needs. It first starts off by asking the student what subject they need help in, the type of help they need, and what type of learners they are. The student responses are taken into account and are matched with a suitable student tutor available to help.

## Inspiration
As college students who have a lot on their plates, it is sometimes difficult to actively find help. With this chatbot, we intend to help other college students through an online platform, in efforts to offer easily accessible assistance with a touch of a hand.

## Language and Tools Used
This project is entirely coded in Java. In order to build the program, we used Chatbot, Java, Eclipse, and references to AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) implementation.

## Accomplishments
As our first collegiate hackathon, an accomplishment we are proud of is being able to complete our first project. A big factor in accomplishing our project was being able to accomplish challenges as a team.

## Challenges and Takeaways
A few of the challenges we ran into was finding a feasible idea to develop/create. Through working with multiple mentors and asking a series of questions, we were able to narrow down our ideas to a simple yet effective project. Through this experience, we enhanced our knowledge of how to generate various outputs based on different inputs. We also learned how to create a simple chatbot program in Java AIML through eclipse for the first time.

## Next Steps
A few things that are next for PurdueTutor is to gather information to create a database comprised of Purdue student tutors in efforts to offer Purdue students more suitable tutors and help.
